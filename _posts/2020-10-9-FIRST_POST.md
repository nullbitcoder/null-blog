# First Blog

Hello,

first thank you for taking time to read this,

Secondly my goal behind creating this blog is to show not only what I'm working on, but also how I ended up completing the project in general. As a new developer/engineer/Bug bounty hunter/all things tech, often people show the end result, without revealing the "yellow brick road" that led to figuring it out in the first place. Hopefully, by writing up some of my projects through this blog, I can help someone see the process of learning how to learn in action. Giving them a flash light in heading down that road for themselves, as I too learn how to learn.

Happy coding!
